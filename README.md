Escoop is a programming language combining ECS (Entity Component System) and OOP (Object Oriented Programming). 
It also uses almost zero symbols, and can be programmed without using a shift key. (As long as you don't use strings or math except for division)

To contribute to Escoop, or just to try to understand how the language works, there is an [advanced Hello World](https://github.com/EscoopPL/HelloWorld/tree/v2) program.
